## Information about using the program
* To graphically move the turtle in the pool, there are two ways. One thing the user has to do first in either way is to click on the turtle to set it active. The active turtle will be larger. One way after that is to use “w, a, s, d” keys to move forward, turn left, backwards, and turn right. The other way is to simply drag the turtle around with your mouse. To view the current properties of the turtle, press “I” to get a popup window. Once the user releases “I”, the window disappears.
* Use the “set” command to save user-defined variables and they will show up in the “Variable” tab.
* All user-defined commands will show up in the “Command” tab. Click on them to run them again.
* Use the “Pen Setting” tab to change stroke size and pen down or pen up.
* Use the “Palette” tab to change the color of Pen and Background of the turtle-pool. Click on the colored block to change colors.
* Use the “Shapes” tab to change to a turtle of choice. Click on the turtle to make change.
* Use the “Options” tab to get the Help page, create a new Workspace, save and load Workspace preferences, and change language of the commands. 
* Use the Textfield to enter basic commands, define variables, and make user-defined commands. Click the “Run” button to run or hit “Ctrl+Enter” to run.
* Use the “Load” button next to the Textfield to load .logo files. 
* Use the “Save” button next to the Textfield to save all command history.
* All return values of all commands will be printed under the corresponding command.
* Click any command in the command history field to run it again.
